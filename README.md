# JWeather

A weather application built with React and CSS.


### About the project 

This project is my first React app and was created using `create-react-app`. It uses an API from openWeatherMap for all weather data requests. You can search your location using the text input on the bottom of the app. You can toggle between metrical and imperial units of measurement by clicking on the hamburger icon.  
You can view a live demo over at https://j04kh.github.io/jweather
